The implementation should be fixed:
1. ALL nodes have the same ps-capable hardware
2. ALL measurements use ps timing
3. Clean links achieve mm accuracy
4. Multipath links remain limited to ~30cm
5. Nearest-neighbor approach maximizes clean links

The question isn't "which links have ps?"
It's "which links benefit from ps?"
Answer: The clean, short, LOS links to nearest neighbors!
