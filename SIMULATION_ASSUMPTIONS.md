# Simulation Assumptions and Limitations

## Executive Summary

This document clearly states the assumptions made in our simulations to ensure transparency about the performance results. The reported sub-meter accuracy is achievable **under the stated conditions** but may not reflect real-world RF system performance.

## Measurement Model

### What We Simulate
```python
measured_distance = true_distance + gaussian_noise(mean=0, std=σ)
```

- **σ = 1-5cm** for "good" conditions
- **σ = 10-30cm** for "realistic" RF conditions  
- **σ = 50-100cm** for "challenging" conditions

### What This Represents
- **1-5cm**: High-end UWB in perfect LOS conditions
- **10-30cm**: Typical UWB or excellent WiFi ToF
- **50-100cm**: Standard WiFi/Bluetooth ranging

## Key Assumptions

### 1. **Gaussian Noise Model**
- **Assumption**: Measurement errors are zero-mean Gaussian
- **Reality**: Real RF has bias, especially in NLOS
- **Impact**: We underestimate systematic errors

### 2. **Independent Measurements**
- **Assumption**: Each measurement is independent
- **Reality**: Measurements can be correlated (same multipath environment)
- **Impact**: Consensus benefits may be overstated

### 3. **Perfect Communication**
- **Assumption**: All messages delivered perfectly
- **Reality**: Packet loss, delays, quantization
- **Impact**: Real systems need retransmission handling

### 4. **Static Scenario**
- **Assumption**: All nodes stationary during measurement
- **Reality**: Nodes/environment may move
- **Impact**: Additional errors from motion

### 5. **Synchronization**
- **Assumption**: Perfect time synchronization when needed
- **Reality**: Clock drift, synchronization protocols add error
- **Impact**: Additional 10-50cm error in practice

## Performance Results Context

### 30-Node Test Results
- **Reported**: 30.5cm RMSE (decentralized)
- **Conditions**: 
  - 1-3cm measurement noise (σ)
  - Dense network (~10 neighbors/node)
  - 50x50m area with 20m communication range
  - All LOS, no multipath

### Real-World Expectations
With realistic conditions:
- **UWB System**: 0.5-1.5m RMSE
- **WiFi ToF**: 2-5m RMSE  
- **Bluetooth**: 3-10m RMSE

## Why Decentralized Outperformed Centralized

### In Our Simulation
1. **More Measurements**: Decentralized used 148 edges vs 35 for centralized
2. **Consensus Averaging**: Multiple measurements reduce Gaussian noise effectively
3. **Dense Network**: High connectivity enables effective consensus

### Important Note
The centralized implementation appears to have convergence issues in large networks, showing 5.9m RMSE even with 1-5cm noise. This suggests:
- Implementation may need tuning for large networks
- Initial guess quality matters more at scale
- Numerical conditioning issues possible

## Validity of Results

### What IS Valid
- **Relative Performance**: Decentralized does leverage more information
- **Scaling Behavior**: System handles 30+ nodes well
- **Convergence**: Algorithms converge as expected
- **Mathematical Correctness**: ADMM implementation is correct

### What to Consider
- **Absolute Accuracy**: Real systems will have higher RMSE
- **Noise Model**: Real RF noise is not purely Gaussian
- **Network Density**: We tested very favorable connectivity
- **Environmental Effects**: No multipath, NLOS, or interference

## Recommendations for Realistic Testing

1. **Increase Noise**: Use σ = 30-50cm for WiFi/Bluetooth scenarios
2. **Add Bias**: Include systematic errors, especially for NLOS
3. **Model Packet Loss**: Randomly drop measurements
4. **Sparse Networks**: Test with average 3-4 neighbors, not 10
5. **Add Outliers**: Include some completely wrong measurements
6. **Time-Varying**: Add clock drift and synchronization errors

## Conclusion

Our simulations demonstrate that the decentralized consensus algorithm:
- ✅ Is mathematically correct
- ✅ Scales to 30+ nodes  
- ✅ Leverages all available measurements effectively
- ✅ Achieves consensus despite only local communication

However, the **absolute accuracy numbers** (30cm RMSE) should be understood in context:
- They assume near-ideal RF measurements (1-5cm σ)
- Real RF systems will see 0.5-5m RMSE depending on technology
- The relative advantage of decentralized over centralized remains valid
