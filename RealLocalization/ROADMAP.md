   - Add multipath gradually
   - Validate variance formulas

2. **Create simple 3-node test**
   - 2 anchors, 1 unknown
   - Test full pipeline
   - Verify sub-meter accuracy

3. **Build message protocol**
   - Start with basic SYNC messages
   - Add ranging messages
   - Implement neighbor discovery

## Success Criteria

- Robust to 20% NLOS measurements
- 10 Hz update rate
- Scales to 100+ nodes

## Lessons from MPS Investigation

1. **Academic papers often ignore real physics** - The MPS paper's 5% noise model is useless
2. **Synchronization is critical** - Can't assume perfect clocks
3. **Robust costs are essential** - Squared error fails with outliers
4. **Early stopping is a band-aid** - Good algorithms shouldn't degrade
5. **Test with realistic channels** - Or you're solving a toy problem

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 3**: 2-3 days (channel models)
- **Phase 4**: 2 days (message protocol)
- **Phase 5**: 3-4 days (distributed solver)
- **Phase 6**: 2-3 days (integration)
- **Phase 7**: Future work

**Total**: ~2 weeks for MVP

## Contact & Notes

This is a **real** localization system addressing **real** physics, unlike the MPS paper's toy model. We're building what the paper should have been - a practical, deployable system that actually works in the field.

**Key Insight**: The spec documents provided are production-grade. They come from real-world experience and address all the issues we discovered with the MPS paper.
