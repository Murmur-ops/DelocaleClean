Our "too good" results (30cm RMSE) assumed:
• 1-5cm measurement noise (laboratory conditions)
• 10 neighbors per node (very dense)
• 0% NLOS (perfect visibility)
• No outliers or failures

Realistic performance expectations:
• UWB in good conditions: 0.3-0.8m RMSE
• WiFi ToF indoor: 1-2m RMSE  
• Bluetooth/WiFi RSSI: 3-5m RMSE
• Harsh environments: 5-10m RMSE

The algorithms are CORRECT, but real-world conditions
introduce 10-100x more error than our ideal simulations.
